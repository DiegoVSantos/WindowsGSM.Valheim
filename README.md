# WindowsGSM.Valheim
ðŸ§©WindowsGSM plugin that provides Valheim Dedicated server support!

# The Game
https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/

# Requirements
WindowsGSM >= 1.21.0

Edit the file start_headless_server.bat, it will be in charge of running the server.

For now the server works with a password, you have to put 5 numbers or 5 letters minimum, it is mandatory !!!

The number of connected players does not work, I deduce that it is possibly due to having to put the server with a password

# Installation
  1. Download the latest release
  2. Move Valheim.cs folder to plugins folder
  3. Click [RELOAD PLUGINS] button or restart WindowsGSM
